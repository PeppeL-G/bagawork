# Bagawork
Bagawork is an application framework that has been designed to be very easy to use. Its primary target group is people new to programming. By using Bagawork, they will:

* Have an easy time getting started, because no installation is required, they just need to open [bagawork.com/editor](https://bagawork.com/editor/) in a web browser on a desktop computer/laptop
* Start by implementing the application's graphical user interface using simple and well-documented components, so hard algorithmic thinking is initially not needed
* Easily preview what the graphical user interface looks like, and see how the user can navigate between the different pages in the app
* Easily share the code they've written online with others (as URLs), so others online easily can help them when they get stuck
* Easily publish apps they have created online, so others can install them (as progressive web applications) and start using them right away, which gives them a satisfying feeling and encourages them to improve their apps and develop more apps (i.e. encourages them to become better programmers)
