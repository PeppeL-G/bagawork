# 6. Sizing GUI Components
This tutorial will teach you how you can change size of GUI components.



## Positioning children
First, some quick repetition.

The child components in `Rows` are as wide as the `Rows` component, and their height are just tall enough to surround their content, and the children are positioned at the top of `Rows`. To position the child components elsewhere in `Rows`, you can insert extra `Space` components in `Rows` to push apart the children. The `Space` cihldren which will share the remaining space available in `Rows` evenly among themselves.

It works the same for the `Columns` component, but the children are instead positioned as columns, and not as rows.

::: tip Example

Try resizing the app below, and notice how the `Space` children gets smaller/bigger, while the three other children stay at the same size.

## Sizing children
It's not only `Space` children that can grab some shares of the remaining available space; any child component used in `Rows` and `Columns` can grab some of the remaining available space. But it's only the `Space` children that grabs it by default, and by default they grab equally much of it. But all this can be changed with the configuration method `.size()` on the children. Let's go through how this works in detail.

First, let us ignore the `Space` children, and instead focus on all other children, such as `Text` and `Button`.

By default, all children in `Rows` will be just tall enough to surround their content. If you want them to also grab some of the remaining available space, you can call the method `.size()` on the child, and pass it a number indicating how many shares of the remaining available space it should also occupy. 

::: tip Examples

A few examples.

:::

The special thing with the `Space` component is that it has the size `1` by default (it has been made like this because that's often how one wants to use it), while all other components has the size `0` by default (which means they will be ust big enough to surround their content).

So when you use the `Space` component like this:

```js
Space
```

It has the same functionality as being used like this:

```js
Space.size(1)
```

You can still call `.size()` on `Space` if you want it to claim another amount of shares of the remaning available space.

## That's it!
Good work, now you know how to change the size of GUI components! ðŸ¥³ Using `Rows` and `Columns` with `.size()` on the children is enough to create almost any layout you want.
