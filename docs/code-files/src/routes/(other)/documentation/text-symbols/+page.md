## Introduction
In a Javascript, you can not only put ordinary characters like `a`, `b`, `7`, `-`, etc. in string, but also many different type of characters that look like small images, such as ⚄ and ☺. This page shows some of these symbols you can use in your app. On other websites, for example [unicode-explorer.com](https://unicode-explorer.com/), you can find more of these symbols. There you can for example search for `heart` and see all symbols related to that word.
