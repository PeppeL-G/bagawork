# Contact
If you:

* Discover a bug
* Have suggestions on improvements (regarding the framework, the editor or this website)
* Need help

Just open an issue in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/PeppeL-G/bagawork/issues). We can't promise we have time to help you, but it's always good for us to know what is hard to learn when using BagaWork, and what we can do to make it better.

Thank you for your support! ❤️
