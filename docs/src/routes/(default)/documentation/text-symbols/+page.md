# Text Symbols
On this page you find many symbols you can use in strings. 



## Introduction
In a JavaScript, you can not only put ordinary characters like `a`, `b`, `7`, `-`, etc. in strings, but also many different type of characters that look like small images, such as ⚄ and ☺. This page shows some of these symbols you can use in your app.

On other websites, for example [unicode-explorer.com](https://unicode-explorer.com/), you can find many more of these symbols. There you can for example search for `heart` and see all symbols related to that word.

::: warning All symbols might not work!

You might not see some of the symbols below, and those you do see might not work on all devices your app will run on. The more modern device the app runs on, the more likely it is that it can show the symbol.
