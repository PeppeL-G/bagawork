# Tutorials
On these pages you find tutorials that will help you learn how to create BagaWork apps. The tutorials have been written for people that have no previous experience of programming at all, so hopefully most can follow along in them without too much difficulties. 

If you do get stuck, or if there's something you don't understand, feel free to ask us for help by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/PeppeL-G/bagawork/issues) in our issue tracker on GitHub (requires a free GitHub account) and explain what you need help with, and we will try to help you as soon as we can! It is important for us to know what people find difficult to learn and use in BagaWork (so we can try to make it even easier to learn and use), so if you tell us that, then we will do our best to help you in return ðŸ™‚

Start with [Tutorial 1. Introduction](./fundamentals/introduction/).
